        <h2>Introduction/Background</h2>
        <p> 
          The US presidential election is incredibly important since our country is arguably the most 
          influential in the world. It not only directly influences our domestic economic market and over 
          300 million citizens, but also the global market and consequently the entire world. Understanding 
          complex factors that affect a presidential election are extremely important, particularly this 
          year as it is an election year. 
        </p>
        <p>
          An interesting thing to note is that few studies look at how a variety of features influence the 
          election on a state level. We plan to investigate features such as demographics, government data, and 
          economic data to see what features help to predict the outcome of an election. Additionally, the results for 
          most studies are binary, whether one candidate will win the election. We plan to look at the ratio between 
          votes for the democratic party versus votes for the republican party.

      <!-- Expected Methods -->
      <section>
        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p> 
          Current forecasting methods typically used are financial prediction markets and pre-polling 
          which have shown to be quite accurate, one article citing it at 1.5% and 2.1% error respectively 
          days before the 2008 election. However, the limitations of this are the national popular vote in 
          U.S. presidential elections tend to oscillate wildly in the months before the election takes place, 
          so we intend to not use polling and prediction market methods in favor of more objective data points. 
          We believe this combined with machine learning techniques will allow us to find more complex trends 
          that would be hard to notice via more classical methods. Around halfway through our project duration, 
          we want to gather all data sets we would need from at least 2 election cycles, a general feature list 
          with relevant feature engineering, and a set of most impactful features found via preliminary results 
          from unsupervised learning.
        </p>
        <b>Data Combination/Cleaning </b>
        <p>       
        When collecting our data, we wanted to consider features from reliable data sources that were most likely to have an effect on political data. We focused on three    different categories of data: demographic, economic, and political data. The demographic data, extracted from the census, highlights sex, race, age (in ranges), and hispanic descent. Economic data, including GDP, personal consumption expenditure, and personal income are sourced from the bureau of economic analysis. Lastly, presidential approval rating from Gallup polls and data on congressional seats completed the last component of our feature set: political data.
        </p>
        <p>
        Due to constraints from being able to meet in person, we decided that entering all of our data into a Google Sheet would be the best way to combine all of our features. We had 100 rows, one for each state in the years 2012 and 2016, and 26 columns. Many of our values within features were very large, so we normalized the features between 0 and 1. The Google Sheet was then exported as a csv file so that we were able to use machine learning libraries and parse data using Python with ease. 
        </p>
        <b>Unsupervised Learning Portion: </b>
        <h4>Principal Component Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          When we created the correlation matrix of our dataset, we saw just how many of our features were strongly 
          correlated with others. Because of this, we realized we could distill our dataset down to a small number 
          of features and still be able to create accurate clusters, perhaps even more accurate clusters than what 
          could be made with the original dataset. To do this, we relied on the PCA algorithm. The PCA algorithm 
          takes in a dataset and creates a new set of orthogonal features, each a linear transformation of the original 
          features, and orders the features by the variance they contribute to the total variance of the dataset. We 
          used the PCA class of the scikit-learn python library to run PCA on our dataset, and then plotted the explained 
          variance ratio of each new feature. 
          </p>

            </div>
          </div>
        <p>
          As you can see in the graphs, the vast majority of the variance in the dataset is contained by only a handful of 
          the variables. We decided to limit our dataset to the top 5 generated features, as they contained nearly 95% of 
          the variance of the dataset.  
        </p>
        <p>
        We compared our KMeans results with 2 clusters to the true results of the 2012 and 2016 election in order to calculate a misclassification rate.

        <p><b>Supervised Learning Portion: </b>
          With regards to next steps, we plan to begin work on the supervised learning portion of the project. 
          We plan to use supervised learning to train a model which will be able to predict how a state will 
          lean in an election, given the relevant features. The algorithms we plan to use to analyze the data 
          are support vector machines and neural networks. Support vector machines will help us classify the 
          states into their corresponding political groups. With creating a neural network, we will need to 
          do a bit more work. We’ll need to include more data points (election data from 2004 and 2008) in 
          addition to the current data points we have for 2012 and 2016. We plan to double the data points 
          so that we have more information with which to train our model. For these algorithms, we plan to 
          use the five components which resulted from our principal component analysis from the 
          unsupervised learning portion of the project. Once we train our models, we plan to test them with 
          data pulled from the recent general election (2020). However, since the relevant features will most 
          likely not have the proper data yet, we will need to use data from the previous year (2019).

      <!-- Results -->

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p> 
          The specific problem that we are going to solve is predicting the ratio of Republican to Democratic 
          popular vote by state. Our approach is unique as we intend to use machine learning algorithms, not 
          regression or other traditionally linear tactics and data that is demographic, economic, or descriptive 
          of state politics. We anticipate success based on two factors: past works and our intention to increase 
          the level of granularity within our features. Past projects that focus on predicting political outcomes 
          such as “Fundamental Models for Forecasting Elections” by Hummel and Rothschild and “Predicting U.S. 
          president election result based on Google Insights” by Stanford students utilize features that are 
          common to those that we want to incorporate and validate our belief that predictions can be made 
          accurately on a state level.

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>
          One minor risk is we believe that election predictions can affect voting behavior, but overall we do 
          not think that there are significant risks associated with this project. In the final stages of our model, we will run 
          a 5-fold cross validation with our existing data. We will then use our model to predict the 2020 presidential 
          election, which will allow us to verify the model.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our project has two main important contributions. By using unsupervised learning, we will be able to determine 
          which features have either a direct or indirect influence on each state's vote. This way, future polls could 
          implement this information in order to be more accurate. By using supervised learning, we will hopefully build 
          a more accurate model which would be used to predict future elections.
