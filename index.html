        <h2>Introduction/Background</h2>
        <p> The US presidential election is incredibly important since our country is arguably the most influential in the world. It not only directly influences our domestic economic market and over 300 million citizens, but also the global market and consequently the entire world. Understanding factors that affect a presidential go far beyond debates and rally performance are extremely important, particularly this year as it is an election year. </p>

      <!-- Expected Methods -->

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>Current forecasting methods typically used are financial prediction markets and pre-polling which have shown to be quite accurate, one article citing it at 1.5% and 2.1% error respectively days before the 2008 election. However, the limitations of this are the national popular vote in U.S. presidential elections tend to oscillate wildly in the months before the election takes place, so we intend to not use polling and prediction market methods in favor of more objective data points. We believe this combined with machine learning techniques will allow us to find more complex trends that would be hard to notice via more classical methods.

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The problem that we are going to solve is predicting the ratio of Republican to Democratic popular vote by state. Our approach is unique as we intend to use machine learning algorithms, not regression or other traditionally linear tactics and data that is demographic, economic, or descriptive of state politics. We anticipate success based on two factors: past works and our intention to increase the level of granularity within our features. Past projects that focus on predicting political outcomes such as “Fundamental Models for Forecasting Elections” by Hummel and Rothschild and “Predicting U.S. president election result based on Google Insights” by Stanford students utilize features that are common to those that we want to incorporate and validate our belief that predictions can be made accurately on a state level.

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>One minor risk is we believe that election predictions can affect voting behavior, but overall we do not think that there are significant risks associated with this project.We are aiming to finish our analysis and generate predictions before the election. For our midterm check we want to gather all data sets we would need from at least 2 election cycles, a general feature list with relevant feature engineering, and a set of most impactful features found via preliminary results from unsupervised learning. For our final check we will run a 5-fold cross validation with our existing data. We will then use our model to predict the 2020 presidential election, which will allow us to verify the model.
